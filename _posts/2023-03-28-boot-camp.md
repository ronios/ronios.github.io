With the vast amount of technology our Cybersecurity classroom had, it was a waste to just leave it in the dust. So as result, [Eric J](https://35th.io), I, and a few students were tasked to create and implement a Linux based network where our students can perform the many labs we participate in. This lab consisted of the use and configuration of Cisco Switches, Optiplex Desktops, and even some Raspberry Pi's.

As one of our two Team Leaders, I am tasked to lead and organize our team members to prepare for the [Tampa Cybersecurity Competition & Conference](https://www.afcea.org/calendar/eventdet.jsp?event_id=67278). In this competition, teams of ten gather together to complete NICE Challenges (Real world lab-based scenarios). So, it's very important that we use this lab to strengthen/ refine our System Administration, Networking and Incident Response skills.

We have doubts that the time we were given isn't sufficient enough to perform well in the competition. However, I believe that with a good work ethic, we should most definitely succeed during this competition. After all, our students are absolutely brilliant!
