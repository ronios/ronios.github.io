When it came to selecting hardware, I struggled to obtain a server or even a desktop computer. Fortunately, I was presented with a unique opportunity to receive an OptiPlex 7070 as part of my Cybersecurity program. Since acquiring this hardware, it has been a game-changer in my learning experience. I am amazed at how it has accelerated my knowledge in Cybersecurity, far beyond what I thought was possible.

Thanks to this OptiPlex 7070, I was able to create my very own Proxmox Home Lab environment with ease. While setting it up was one thing, diving into the in-depth functionalities proved to be quite challenging. However, I was determined to overcome this hurdle and learned the many quirks about Proxmox. This knowledge not only expanded my understanding of Proxmox but also gave me insight into other forms of Type-1 Hypervisors, such as VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.

### Resources

One of the primary resources I utilized to learn Proxmox was [Learn Linux TV's](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV) full [Proxmox course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKHnlbYhtABg6cF50bYa8Ulo). This detailed course covered many of the meat and potatoes of Proxmox including hardware configuration, network setup, user management, storage allocation, and virtual machine management.

I also suggest [Learn Linux TV's](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV) as an entire resourse for, funnily enough, learning linux.

### My Applications

As of my applications that I currently have configured on Proxmox, I run TrueNAS, OpenVPN, Game Servers, Windows Server, and Cloudflare Tunnels. However, I mainly use my network for a testing lab. I find it incredibly easy to deploy and delete Virtual Machines for Network, and even Pen-Testing needs.

### Future Ideas

In the future of my Proxmox server, I plan to add/ build additional services like SearXNG, Sync-Thing, Plex, and even pfSense!
