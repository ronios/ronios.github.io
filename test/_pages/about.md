Hello! I'm Tony and my passion lies in all things computing. In particular, my main focus of study is in Cybersecurity and the technologies that are associated with this expansive and diverse field. I've been involved in this field for years, starting in High School. While I've had some involvement in the past, I regret not dedicating myself fully to the craft in the past.

I started to become extensively involved and invested in Cybersecurity for an ever-growing

<script>
    function updateTime2() {
    const now = new Date();
    const targetDate = new Date("2022-08-15T20:32:22");
    const diff1 = now.getTime() - targetDate.getTime();
    const days1 = Math.floor(diff1 / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    const hours1 = Math.floor((diff1 % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
    const minutes1 = Math.floor((diff1 % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
    const seconds1 = Math.floor((diff1 % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);
    document.getElementById("time2").textContent = `${days1} days, ${hours1} hours, ${minutes1} minutes, and ${seconds1} seconds.`;
    }
    setInterval(updateTime2, 1000);

This time was roughly the time I began to really apply myself in my life goals and find purpose in the work and academics I put out.

With that out of the way, I am a 17 year old with a strong determination to learn and perform as much as I can in regards to System Administration/ Hardening, Network Administration/ Engineering, Pen-Testing, Cloud Security, and all the works! So far I have been extremely successful in my academic pursuit with my Cybersecurity Career.

As an active member of my Cybersecurity program, I often find myself in leadership positions, collaborating closely with my teammates and classmates. Effective communication is a critical component of any successful endeavor, especially in the field of Cybersecurity. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about the upcoming work and numerous projects I have planned for my Cybersecurity career!

### Current Goals
